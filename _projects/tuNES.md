description: NES Emulator written in C++

Nearing the end of my University studies in late 2017 , I decided to create a NES emulator in C++.
I did this for a few reasons:
	* Something substantial to show in future job interviews that I completed outside of school projects
	(I know now that it did help significantly in getting my first games job!)
	* A way to gain a deeper knowledge on how computer hardware actually works internally to take input, play sound and show images
	* I played the NES a lot as a kid and thought it'd be really to cool to make the same thing in code

Be warned, this is not a feature complete emulator! Audio has not been implemented, and not all games will play
The games not functioning games depend on which cartridge hardware I have implemented, and I had only completed a few.

Some example games that I've confirmed will work include - Zelda, Donkey Kong, Mario Bros, Metroid, Bomberman, Mega Man.

All the source code can be found at https://github.com/domlawlor/tuNES. Be warned, that it's older code that I should really clean up one day :D
It is programmed mostly in plain C with only a few C++ features used. It 

#TODO Find out what state the project it in first

Since completing the bulk of my goal, I've occassionally returned to the project to work on things.
