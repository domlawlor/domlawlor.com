A game jam entry for [GBJAM 10](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-10), a jam where the aim is to make GameBoy inspired games. The additional theme was 'Plant/Plants'  
I teamed up with Tim Day([Gamedev Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NB542RwpJR) | [itch.io](https://bronxtaco.itch.io/)) again for this 10 day jam
We made a cryptic puzzle game about diffuse bombs before they all explode. 

Technically, we aimed to make sure our game followed the technical limitations of the Gameboy.    
  * Visuals are 160x144 pixels and only using 4 colors
  * All art contained to 8x8 tiles, larger items are built from those base tiles. eg. Main character sprite is 16x16
  * Music and sound effects made by Tim, use the gameboys sound hardware 4 channels (2 Square, 1 Wave, and 1 Noise)
  * Controls limited to D-Pad, A, B, Start, and Select. Though analogue stick on gamepad also works for as D-Pad

Out of 185 entries, our game was rated 16th. The puzzles seemed to divide players in how much they enjoyed the game. Some people found the difficulty too high, while others complained it was too easy!!  
It definitely showed us the difficulty of making good puzzles
