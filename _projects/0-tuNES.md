A NES emulator written in C++. It can play play games like Zelda, Donkey Kong, Mario Bros, Metroid, ect  
The emulator is not feature complete, missing implementation for all the different cartridge hardware. Therefore many games do not yet function.
It also does not have an implementation of the Audio Processing Unit(APU), so there is currently no sound or music.

A majority of this project was completed while at Uni in 2017 and 2018. 
I started because I played a lot of NES as a kid and thought it would be cool to make the same thing in code.
Also I wanted a substantial project to be able to show in future job interviews (I found out this is why I got my first games job!) 
Though my biggest takeaway from this project was learning how assembly code actually made the NES hardware do everything. It's since made a lot of programming ideas easier to understand
