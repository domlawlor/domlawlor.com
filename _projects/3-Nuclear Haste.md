Fully playable in browser  here - [Nuclear Haste!](https://bronxtaco.itch.io/nuclear-haste)    (though, I recommend the downloaded version :D )

'Nuclear Haste!' was made for Weekly Game Jam 267 by Tim Day ([Gamedev Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NB542RwpJR) | [itch.io](https://bronxtaco.itch.io/)) and I.  
It was all made in Godot Engine in a 7 day period. Programming work was shared by Tim and I, and the art was sourced from itch.io asset packs (we are not great artists :P)  
Like the previous game jam, we were rated #1 out of 8 entries :D We worked hard on this jam so very happy with the end result.

The theme for this game jam was 'Dust'. Tim and I settled on trying a falling sands simulation and having moving 'dust' particles. The dust eventually became nuclear waste dust and our game idea was born. 

Taking some inspiration from 'cleaning' games like Powerwash Simulator or Viscera Cleanup Detail, our core gameplay was to cleanup the nuclear dust before the scientists return.  
Our janitor character pushes dust in the falling sand simulation, with the aim to burn it all in the incinerating lava

My role in this jam was undertaking the fall sand simulation which was completely new to me, but a welcome challenge.
