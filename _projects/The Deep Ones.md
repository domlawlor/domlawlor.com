The Deeps Ones was made as an entry in [32-bit Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/32bit-jam-2022) by myself and 4 others.  
The aim of 32-Bit Jam is to create a PS1/N64 era style game with an optional themes. This year the themes were Another World or The Ocean (we kinda did both themes)  
All development was done in the 2 week duration of the game jam. And as a team we are very happy with the result. We even got ranked #2 out of 137 entries, only just missing out on first!
