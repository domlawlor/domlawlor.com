Rays of Giza is a simple platformer made in Godot Engine by Tim Day ([Gamedev Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NB542RwpJR) | [itch.io](https://bronxtaco.itch.io/)) and me.  
It's fully playable here - [Rays Of Giza](https://bronxtaco.itch.io/rays-of-giza)  

This was an entry for [Weekly Game Jam 266](https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-266). We signed up for this jam with only a few days left until submission, so we used this jam to prepare for Weekly Game Jam 267.   
Also, it was our first exposure to using Godot, so we used this game as a way for us to learn about the engine and its scripting language, GDScript. 

Overall, I think the end product turned out pretty well. And we managed to be rated #1 ....out of 7 entries :P
