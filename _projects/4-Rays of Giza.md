Rays of Giza is a simple platformer made in Godot Engine by Tim Day ([Gamedev Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NB542RwpJR) | [itch.io](https://bronxtaco.itch.io/)) and me.  
It's fully playable here - [Rays Of Giza](https://bronxtaco.itch.io/rays-of-giza)  

This was an entry in for Weekly Game Jam 266. We signed up for this jam with only a few days left until submission, so we used this jam to prepare for Weekly Game Jam 267.   
Also, it was our first exposure to using Godot just a way for us to learn about the engine and its scripting language (GDScript). 

Overall, I think the end product turned out pretty well. And we manged to be rated #1 ....out of 7 entries :P
